and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewProofOfServiceDocWithDefaults

GetUploads returns the Uploads field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetUploadsOk

`func (o *ProofOfServiceDoc) GetUploadsOk() (*[]UploadWithOmissions, bool)`

GetUploadsOk returns a tuple with the Uploads field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetUploads
