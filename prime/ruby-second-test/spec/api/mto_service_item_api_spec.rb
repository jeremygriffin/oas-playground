  # unit tests for create_mto_service_item
  # createMTOServiceItem
  # Creates one or more MTOServiceItems. Not all service items may be created, please see details below.  This endpoint supports different body definitions. In the modelType field below, select the modelType corresponding  to the service item you wish to create and the documentation will update with the new definition.  Upon creation these items are associated with a Move Task Order and an MTO Shipment. The request must include UUIDs for the MTO and MTO Shipment connected to this service item. Some service item types require additional service items to be autogenerated when added - all created service items, autogenerated included, will be returned in the response.  To update a service item, please use [updateMTOServiceItem](#operation/updateMTOServiceItem) endpoint.  ---  **&#x60;MTOServiceItemOriginSIT&#x60;**  MTOServiceItemOriginSIT is a subtype of MTOServiceItem.  This model type describes a domestic origin SIT service item. Items can be created using this model type with the following codes:  **DOFSIT**  **1st day origin SIT service item**. When a DOFSIT is requested, the API will auto-create the following group of service items:   * DOFSIT - Domestic origin 1st day SIT   * DOASIT - Domestic origin Additional day SIT   * DOPSIT - Domestic origin SIT pickup   * DOSFSC - Domestic origin SIT fuel surcharge  **DOASIT**  **Addt&#39;l days origin SIT service item**.
