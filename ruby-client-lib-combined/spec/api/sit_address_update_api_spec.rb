  # createSITAddressUpdateRequest
  # **Functionality:** Creates an update request for a SIT service item&#39;s final delivery address. A newly created update request is assigned the status &#39;REQUESTED&#39;  if the change in address is &gt; 50 miles and automatically approved otherwise.  **Limitations:** The update can be requested for APPROVED SIT service items only. Only ONE request is allowed per approved SIT service item.  **DEPRECATION ON AUGUST 5TH, 2024** Following deprecation, when updating a service item&#39;s final delivery address, you will need to update the shipment&#39;s destination address. This will update the destination SIT service items&#39; final delivery address upon approval. For &#x60;APPROVED&#x60; shipments, you can use [updateShipmentDestinationAddress](#mtoShipment/updateShipmentDestinationAddress) For shipments in any other status, you can use [updateMTOShipmentAddress](#mtoShipment/updateMTOShipmentAddress)
