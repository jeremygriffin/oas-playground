## Methods

### NewProofOfServiceDocV2

`func NewProofOfServiceDocV2() *ProofOfServiceDocV2`

NewProofOfServiceDocV2 instantiates a new ProofOfServiceDocV2 object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewProofOfServiceDocV2WithDefaults

`func NewProofOfServiceDocV2WithDefaults() *ProofOfServiceDocV2`

NewProofOfServiceDocV2WithDefaults instantiates a new ProofOfServiceDocV2 object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetUploads

`func (o *ProofOfServiceDocV2) GetUploads() []UploadWithOmissionsV2V2`

GetUploads returns the Uploads field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetUploadsOk

`func (o *ProofOfServiceDocV2) GetUploadsOk() (*[]UploadWithOmissionsV2V2, bool)`

GetUploadsOk returns a tuple with the Uploads field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetUploads

`func (o *ProofOfServiceDocV2) SetUploads(v []UploadWithOmissionsV2V2)`

SetUploads sets Uploads field to given value.

### HasUploads

`func (o *ProofOfServiceDocV2) HasUploads() bool`

HasUploads returns a boolean if a field has been set.
